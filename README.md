# MultiPhaseAnalysisAndTaxonomy

A repository for analysis of operating regimes and setpoints of five-phase machines. We generalize the well-known classification for three-phase systems:

- MTPA (maximum torque per ampere): operation of the machine without any active constraint.
- FW (field weakening): operation region of the machine with active voltage constraint.

Due to the interplay of the third and fifth harmonics, we propose a richer taxonomy, where each of the region takes two indices, where the first one denotes the number of active constraints on current and the other one the number of active constraint on voltage.

Details are provided in our [paper](). This repository provides a way to recreate the results from the paper.
